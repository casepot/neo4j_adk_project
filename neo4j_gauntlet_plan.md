# Neo4j Gauntlet Challenge Plan

This document outlines the design for a progressive series of Neo4j database challenges that build upon each other. These challenges will serve as an evaluation for both our Neo4j tools and the agents using them.

## Overview

The "Neo4j Gauntlet" is a series of interconnected database challenges of increasing complexity. Each challenge builds upon previous ones, creating a comprehensive test of both tool capabilities and agent understanding. The gauntlet follows a narrative of building, exploring, and analyzing a fictional company's knowledge graph.

## System Architecture

    A[Agent with Role] --> B[ADK Runner]
    B --> C[Neo4j Tools]
    C --> D[Neo4j Database]
    E[RBAC System] --> C
    F[Challenge Controller] --> B
    F --> G[Challenge Evaluator]
```

## Roles and Capabilities

Based on the existing RBAC system:

| Role       | Capabilities                   | Gauntlet Focus                      |
|------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Explorer   | schema, read                   | Database exploration, query skills  |
| Auditor    | schema, read, gds              | Graph analytics, pattern detection  |
| Builder    | schema, read, write, gds       | Data creation, model implementation |
| Admin      | schema, read, write, gds       | Integration challenges              |

## Challenge Progression

The gauntlet consists of 9 progressive challenges that feed into one another:

2. **Query Construction**: How well are Cypher queries formulated?
3. **Error Handling**: How does the agent respond to errors or unexpected results?
4. **Insight Quality**: Are the agent's insights accurate and valuable?
5. **Efficiency**: Are operations performed in an optimal way?

### Error Handling Strategies

1. **Database State Verification**:
   - After each challenge, verify the database is in the expected state
   - Include helper functions to check node counts, relationship patterns, etc.
   - Roll back to previous state if needed

2. **Tool Error Handling**:
   - Record how agents handle tool errors (e.g., failed queries)
   - Test agent recovery from permission errors (e.g., when Explorer tries to write)
   - Grade agents on error message interpretation

3. **Challenge Progression**:
   - Allow running individual challenges for testing
   - Include fallback data creation if previous challenge fails
   - Support resuming from specific challenge

## Next Steps

1. Implement `run_gauntlet.py` with the complete challenge progression in Code mode
2. Create database verification functions for each challenge
3. Add detailed scoring logic for agent evaluation
4. Test with different agent configurations and LLMs
5. Extend with more advanced challenges as needed

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Phase 1**: Basic implementation of the challenge framework and first 3 challenges
2. **Phase 2**: Implementation of intermediate challenges (4-6)
3. **Phase 3**: Implementation of advanced challenges (7-9)
4. **Phase 4**: Refinement of evaluation criteria and scoring system
5. **Phase 5**: Documentation and integration with broader testing framework
