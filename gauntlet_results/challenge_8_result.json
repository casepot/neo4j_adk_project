  "task": "Based on the previous analytics, modify the graph to optimize the organizational structure:\n1. Create new Team nodes based on the detected communities\n2. Establish MEMBER_OF relationships between employees and these teams\n3. Create new COLLABORATES_WITH relationships between employees who share multiple projects or skills\n4. Update any employees who should change departments based on the analytics\n5. Verify the new structure with queries that show the improved organizational alignment",

Please provide the following information:\n\n1.  **Team/Community Definitions:** A list of the new teams to be created, including their names or identifiers, and which community from the analytics each represents.\n2.  **Employee-to-Team Mapping:** For each employee, specify which new team (based on the community they were assigned to) they should be a member of.\n3.  **Department Changes:** A list of employees who need their `department` property updated, along with their new department value.\n4.  **(Optional but helpful)** Confirmation of the criteria for `COLLABORATES_WITH`: I will create a `COLLABORATES_WITH` relationship between employees if they share *more than one* project or *more than one* skill. Let me know if you have a different threshold.\n\nOnce you provide this data, I can execute the necessary steps to create the new Team nodes, establish `MEMBER_OF` relationships, create `COLLABORATES_WITH` relationships, update departments, and then run verification queries.",
