Update any employees who should change departments based on the analytics\n5. Verify the new structure with queries that show the improved organizational alignment",

  "response": "Okay, I understand you want to modify the graph based on the results of your previous analytics to optimize the organizational structure. This involves creating new Team nodes, adding `MEMBER_OF` and `COLLABORATES_WITH` relationships, and updating employee departments.\n\nTo proceed with these modifications accurately, I need the specific data derived from your analysis:\n\n1.  **Team Membership:** Please provide the list of identified teams or communities and which employees belong to each. This information is needed to create the `Team` nodes and the `MEMBER_OF` relationships.\n2.  **Collaboration Pairs:** Please provide the list of employee pairs that should be connected by the new `COLLABORATES_WITH` relationship based on shared projects or skills.\n3.  **Department Updates:** Please provide the list of employees whose department property needs to be updated and their new department values.\n\nOnce I have this detailed information, I can write and execute the necessary Cypher queries to modify the graph structure as you've outlined and then perform verification queries.",
