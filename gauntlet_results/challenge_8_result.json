Update any employees who should change departments based on the analytics\n5. Verify the new structure with queries that show the improved organizational alignment",

However, I need the specific details from those analytics to perform the requested changes.\n\nPlease provide the following information:\n\n1.  **Team Creation (Communities):** What are the specific community IDs or names, and which employees belong to each new team? (e.g., \"Community A includes Employee 1, Employee 5, Employee 10; Community B includes Employee 2, Employee 7...\")\n2.  **COLLABORATES_WITH Relationships:** Based on your analysis of shared projects/skills, which pairs of employees should have a `COLLABORATES_WITH` relationship created? (e.g., \"Create COLLABORATES_WITH between Employee 3 and Employee 8; Employee 6 and Employee 9...\")\n3.  **Department Updates:** Which employees need to change departments, and what is the new department for each of them? (e.g., \"Employee 4 should move to 'Marketing'; Employee 11 should move to 'Research'...\")\n\nOnce I have these details, I can create a plan to implement the changes in the database and then verify them.",
