It seems the `YIELD` clause fields I'm using are not matching what the procedure expects in this environment, or there's an underlying issue with the GDS calls themselves.\n\nGiven the repeated failures to create the graph projection, I am unable to proceed with the Betweenness Centrality and Degree Centrality algorithms, as they require a projected graph to run on.\n\nIt appears there is a persistent issue with correctly calling the graph projection procedure in this environment. I cannot complete the requested graph analytics tasks without a successful graph projection.\n\nI recommend checking the specific version of the Graph Data Science library installed and the correct syntax for the `YIELD` clause and projection parameters for `gds.graph.project` and `gds.graph.project.cypher` in this environment.",
