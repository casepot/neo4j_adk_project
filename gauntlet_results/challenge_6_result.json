  "task": "Perform these graph analytics tasks:\n1. Create a native projection for the organizational structure (departments, employees, reporting relationships)\n2. Run betweenness centrality to identify key employees in the communication flow\n3. Compute degree centrality to find the most connected employees\n4. Analyze the results: Who are the most central employees based on these measures?",

  "response": "I was unable to retrieve the node labels and relationship types from the database using the schema tools or direct Cypher calls (`CALL db.labels()`, `CALL db.relationshipTypes()`). This information is essential for creating the graph projection needed for the analytics tasks you requested.\n\nSpecifically, I need to know:\n1.  What node label represents employees (e.g., `Employee`, `Person`)?\n2.  What node label represents organizational units (e.g., `Department`, `Team`)?\n3.  What relationship type represents reporting lines between employees (e.g., `REPORTS_TO`, `MANAGES`)?\n4.  What relationship type connects employees to their organizational units (e.g., `WORKS_IN`, `MEMBER_OF`)?\n\nWithout knowing these labels and relationship types, I cannot define the necessary `nodeProjection` and `relationshipProjection` for the `gds.graph.project.native` call, which is the first step required before running algorithms like Betweenness Centrality and Degree Centrality.\n\nTherefore, I cannot proceed with creating the projection or running the requested centrality algorithms at this time.",
