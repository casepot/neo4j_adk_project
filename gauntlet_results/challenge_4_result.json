What is the reporting chain from the lowest-level employee to the top manager?\n3. Are there any employees who are in one department but report to a manager in another department?\n4. Find the department with the deepest management hierarchy",

Here are the answers to your questions:\n\n1.  **Highest-level managers:** There isn't a single highest-level manager. The employees who do not report to anyone are **Diana Prince**, **Frank White**, and **Alice Smith**.\n2.  **Example reporting chain:** An example of a reporting chain from a lower-level employee to a top manager is: **Charlie Brown** (Marketing Specialist) reports to **Diana Prince** (Marketing Manager).\n3.  **Cross-departmental reporting:** Yes, there are employees who are in one department but report to a manager in another department. I found **50** such instances.\n4.  **Department with the deepest hierarchy:** The department with the deepest management hierarchy is **Engineering**, with a maximum hierarchy depth of **5** levels (meaning the longest reporting chain from an employee in Engineering up to a top manager is 5 steps).\n\nI hope this information is helpful for understanding the organizational structure in your database.",
